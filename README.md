# AutoTune MySQL/MariaDB Config Generator

This Bash script automatically generates optimized MySQL/MariaDB configuration parameters based on the system's available memory and architecture. It is ideal for sysadmins, DevOps engineers, and anyone looking to deploy database servers efficiently without manually tuning performance settings.

## Features

- Detects total system memory and architecture (32-bit / 64-bit)
- Calculates and sets critical MySQL/MariaDB parameters:
  - `innodb_buffer_pool_size`
  - `query_cache_size`
  - `max_connections`
  - `table_open_cache`
  - `key_buffer_size`
